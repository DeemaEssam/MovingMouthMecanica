# MovingMouthMecanica

I designed a 3D model for moving a mouth using two servo motors. motors are attached to the upper jaw and connected to the lower jaw. When the servo motor moves upwards, it pulls the lower jaw up, closing the mouth. When the servo motor moves downwards, it pushes the lower jaw down, opening the mouth.
